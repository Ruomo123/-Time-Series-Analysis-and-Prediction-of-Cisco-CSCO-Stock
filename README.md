# -Time-Series-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Cisco-CSCO-Stock
This is one of the tasks I did during the internship at Allied Millennial Partners, a financial service company located at the Three World Financial Center, New York. I use stock price from Yahoo Finance to analyze Ciscoâ€™s stock price from 2005 to 2019. I explored several time series models and finally used ARIMA model to identify the characteristics of the stock, including seasonality, Day of the Week Effect, and predicted the stock based on history stock price data.  * This work has been approved to be published by Allied Millennial Partners
